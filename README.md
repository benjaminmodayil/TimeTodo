## What is it?

TaskToDo is an application where you can track your tasks and your time for those tasks.

After you signup you'll be able to track your tasks and time.

Essentially, the application is the child of a todo list and a pomodoro timer with a timelog sheet.

## Design

TaskToDo was designed by me, [Benjamin Modayil](https://www.modayil.me) using Sketch on Mac.
